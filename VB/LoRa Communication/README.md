## LoRa Communication

In this folder all documentation and scripts related to LoRa communication of the Vibration Sensor can be found.

### Conversion

The Vibration Sensor communicates over LoRaWAN using a binary protocol. Usually the binary protocol is converted at the LoRa network server to an easier to handle format: JSON.

- encoding: from JSON to a binary string for to the Vibration Sensor
- decoding: from a binary string from the Vibration Sensor to JSON

#### Encoder / decoder

Soon this folder will contain Javascript files that can help with the conversion, in for example the LoRa network server.

#### Conversion examples

Soon conversion examples will be added here, together with corresponding Javascript files in the examples folder.
