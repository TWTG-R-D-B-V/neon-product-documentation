In this folder all documentation and scripts related to LoRa communication of the specific product can be found. 

### Online configurator

The device is configurable over LoRaWAN. To help generate a configuration, our [NEON Configurator](https://neon-configurator.twtg.io/neon/ts/v2/) can be used. This configurator is an online form with all possible settings within their allowed ranges. After tailoring the settings to your application you can then generate a LoRaWAN message to be sent via your network server.
